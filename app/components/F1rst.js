                        Millions of Indians can either not obtain a credit card or do not want one. Why? It should come as no surprise given that credit cards may promote excessive spending, carry high-interest rates, and may be challenging to use or just unavailable. But regardless of your goals in life, most individuals want credit at some time.<br /><br />
                        A good credit score may transform lives, particularly when it comes to significant long-term objectives like obtaining a loan or obtaining the best repayment option for major purchases. Despite this, there aren't many other options for establishing credit. To remedy that, we set out.

                        Indians often rely on credit—the ability to buy things with borrowed money that's paid back over time—to finance major purchases, such as buying a car or home, and to make life easier with conveniences like credit cards, which can help you manage your daily spending. To determine whether you qualify for such loans, lenders may look at a number of factors, including your income, debt-to-income ratio, and even employment history.<br /><br />
                        But they also almost always rely on an automated evaluation process that includes considering your credit scores and credit history to determine how likely you are to pay back your debts on time. A credit score is a three-digit number that's calculated by applying a mathematical algorithm to the information in one of your 4 credit reports (from Experian, TransUnion, CRIF, or Equifax), which are updated regularly with information from your credit accounts. Typically, the higher your credit scores, the more likely you are to qualify for loans with the most favorable terms, including lower interest rates, higher dollar amounts, and potentially lower fees.<br /><br />
                        Having a good credit score comes with many advantages, including:<br /><br />

                        Let's get the elephant out of the room. I would like to utilize Cred's visual language for my app, F1rst, as I believe it perfectly embodies the simplicity and accessibility that I aim to bring to the credit building experience. From Cred's sleek and minimalist design, to their use of bold typography and pops of color, I believe that incorporating their design elements into F1rst will not only make it visually appealing, but also help convey the message of convenience and ease to potential users. By using Cred's visual language, I hope to bring their level of trust and credibility to the table and make credit building accessible to everyone.
